## Description

This keylogger is designed to monitor keyboard input, gather system information, and capture screenshots. It saves keystrokes to a log file, collects details about the host machine (including hostname, IP address, operating system, and processor), and takes screenshots of the active screen. All this information is then sent to a specified email address. The collected data can be optionally encrypted before being emailed. Finally, the keylogger attempts to remove the original log files to conceal its activity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Records all keystrokes and saves them to a text file (`key_log.txt`).
- **System Information Gathering:** Collects and saves system information such as hostname, IP address, operating system, and processor details to a text file (`syseminfo.txt`).
- **Screenshot Capture:** Takes screenshots of the active screen and saves them as a PNG image (`screenshot.png`).
- **Email Reporting:** Sends collected keystrokes, system information, and screenshots to a predefined email address.
- **File Encryption:** Encrypts the keylog, system information, and clipboard data using Fernet encryption before emailing.
- **Data Removal:** Attempts to delete the log files and screenshots after sending them via email to remove traces of activity.
